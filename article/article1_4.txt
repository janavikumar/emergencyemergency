All that to say, there are good, beautiful things happening in many communities across the United States. And they're happening quickly, and with fervent passion, because people seem to understand the state that we are in. The lights are on, the ambulances are out, and we're clearing the roads for them to barrel down. To my surprise, however, it seems that the government has turned some lights on, too. At least, at first glance. The most recent National Emergency was declared by President Joe Biden in February of 2024 in the name of protecting the West Bank. Curious, I dug a little closer. And then dug a little wider. What National Emergencies can and do accomplish seems to span a wide range of possibilities, from intimidating worker strikes to expanding Naval militancy to delivering foreign aid to sanctions. Enacted through Proclamations and Executive Orders, however, the way these emergencies are utilized bypasses the checks and balances system, instead giving power of discrepancy and nuance to (usually) the Secretary of the Treasury.
