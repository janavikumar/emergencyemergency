My legs made a wet, unsticking sound as I finally stood up and followed BG out of the bus. She and I parted ways and I pretended to walk with direction and purpose while I figured out what bus would take me back where I needed to go. At my new bus stop, I thought about BG and her passion for emergency. I knew other people shared it. There are good, beautiful things happening in the name of emergency in several communities across the United States. I've heard of many a fundraiser and protest and winter coat drive and food bank and teach-in. It does feel at times like the lights are spinning, the ambulances are out, and we're clearing the roads for them to barrel down, perhaps to pick up the odd downed healthcare oligarch. To my surprise, however, a cursory internet search done while the busses ran late showed that the government has turned some lights on, too. At least, at first glance.
