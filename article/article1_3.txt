Healthcare costs are unmanageable. Late stage capitalism leaves no survivors except for its makers, and if you're not sure whether you're a maker, well. You are probably not. Taxpayer dollars are going to bombs that kill and sweatshops that kill and state-sanctioned violence that kills, and it's waved away by people who think you couldn't possibly understand foreign relations or supply chains or World War II. Misogyny is at an all-time weird. And at the end of the day, again, it's unusually hot for a New York November.
