The 1976 National Emergencies Act further formalized the way Executive Orders were handled. The act ended all previously established national emergencies and formally allowed presidents to declare national emergencies and gain special powers during these times. It also required that the president tell Congress before declaring a national emergency and allowed Congress to terminate the emergency with a joint resolution.
