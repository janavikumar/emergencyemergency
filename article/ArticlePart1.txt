On the morning of November 6th, 2024, I took the M7 deep into Harlem. I didn't need to go as far as I did, but I had fallen into conversation about The Thing That Happened Last Night with somebody's grandmother. It was unusually hot for a New York November, and my Bus Grandma was dabbing beads of sweat off her perfectly made-up face. She spat lightly as she talked and patted my leg with her hand. As she sadly made peace with her future death preceding the presidency of a Black woman, her eyes grew wide. You too, she seemed to accurately appraise me. "Kamala Harris is Indian, too." She said it like she was sure I wouldn't have known that, like many grandmothers think anyone younger than thirty is a babe who can't read. She was so sweet, and I didn't have the heart to tell her when we blew past my stop.
