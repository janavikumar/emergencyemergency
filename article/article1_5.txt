The most recent National Emergency was declared by President Joe Biden in February of 2024 in the name of protecting the West Bank. This seemed at odds with the constant munitions supplying to Israel. Curious, I dug a little closer. And then dug a little wider. What National Emergencies can and do accomplish seems to span a wide range of possibilities, from intimidating worker strikes to delivering foreign aid to expanding Naval militancy to sanctions. Enacted through Proclamations and Executive Orders, the way these emergencies are utilized bypasses the usual checks and balances system and the typical people to House to Senate to President pipeline. Instead, it gives power of discrepancy and nuance to the President and the Secretary of the Treasury. I imagine Joe Biden and Donald Trump jumping out of an ambulance and doing a Chinese Fire Drill before they careen down the tight streets of New York City. They are taking some hard turns. The gurney is clanging violently against the walls of the van. I spent a moment to reminisce about the arguments that broke out after my grandfather was finally told he wasn't allowed to drive anymore.
