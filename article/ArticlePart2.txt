Since emergence, there's been emergency. So much so that the history of U.S. emergency powers somehow predates the United States itself. In 1775, the Continental Congress passed emergency acts in regards to the Revolutionary War.  A century later, Abraham Lincoln famously bypassed congress during the Civil War to block Confederate ports. The first Emergency Proclamation, however, was done by Woodrow Wilson in 1917 during World War I, when he proclaimed that there was insufficient ships to carry resources to and from the United States. The result of the emergency proclamation was a complete government centralization of water transportation. Without this proclamation, U.S. Naval forces would not exist as they do today. As America rose as a global superpower, the effectiveness and global impact of national emergencies grew broader. Presidents chose to bypass Congress via Proclamation or the more en vogue Executive Order. The first Executive Order national emergency was created by Jimmy Carter on the heels of the Iran hostage crisis. The emergency is ongoing today, renewed by each successive president.
