The history of emergency powers in the region predates the United States itself. In 1775, the Continental Congress passed emergency acts in regards to the Revolutionary War. These emergency acts included handling the ongoing crisis with Britain by creating the Continental Army with George Washington as commander, printing money, and boycotting British goods as a form of protest against Britain. Since then, executive powers have bypassed Congress often in times of stress. Abraham Lincoln famously bypassed congress during the Civil War to suspend habeas corpus and proclaim the blockade of Confederate ports. The first Emergency Proclamation, however, was done by Woodrow Wilson in 1917 during World War I, when he proclaimed that there was insufficient maritime resources in the private sector to carry imports and exports from the United States. The result of the emergency proclamation was a complete centralization of water transportation, which was overseen by the government. Without this proclamation, U.S. maritime power and its Naval forces would not exist as they do today. As America rose as a global superpower, the effectiveness and global impact of national emergencies grew broader. Presidents chose to bypass Congress via Proclamation or Executive Order. The first national emergency created by Executive Order was done by Jimmy Carter on the heels in response to the Iran hostage crisis. The emergency is ongoing today, renewed by each successive president.
