Although both can declare national emergencies, Proclamations and Executive Orders are technically different. Historically, Proclamations have tended to be celebratory announcements and are more symbolic in nature. While Proclamations are still utilized to establish states of emergency, they typically deal with private individuals or entities, and usually lack the effect of law unless the President is given authority by the Constitution or a federal article. Executive Orders, on the other hand, are laws enacted by whim of the President. Executive Orders are subject to judicial review in a post Marbury v Madison world. Courts can strike down Executive Orders if they find the order unconstitutional, or if they find it unreasonable, meaning the enacting president lacked authority to issue it in the first place. The Supreme Court, however, has historically exercised extreme caution when reviewing Presidential orders.
