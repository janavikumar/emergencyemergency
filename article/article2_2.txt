The difference between the two is quite simple: historically, Proclamations have tended to be more symbolic in nature. While still utilized to establish states of emergency, they typically deal with private individuals or entities, and usually lack the effect of law unless the President is given authority by the Constitution or a federal article. They are, to water it down, slightly chiller than Executive Orders in terms of actually affecting change. Executive Orders, on the other hand, are laws enacted by whim of the President. In a post Marbury v Madison world, Executive Orders are subject to judicial review. Courts can strike down Executive Orders if they find the order unconstitutional, or if they find it unreasonable, meaning the enacting president lacked authority to issue it in the first place. Public health national emergencies (H1N1, Covid-19) and domestic military issues (George W. Bush calling up retired national guard troops back into action after 9/11) are typically done via proclamation. Economic transactions - trade changes, sanctions - all seem to be Executive Orders. Lately, sanctions are super en vogue, so Executive Order it is! What stands out is that the Supreme Court has historically exercised extreme caution when reviewing Presidential orders. So regardless of Proclamation or Executive Order, it feels as if the document forges forward a President's Desires, no questions asked. Unless you are Abe Lincoln suspending habeas corpus or Harry S. Truman trying to seize private property or George W. Bush violating the Geneva Convention. If you are not those people doing those things, and you are president, get in that ambulance babe! Drive on whatever side of the road you want.
