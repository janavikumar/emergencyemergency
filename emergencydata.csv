USA,23,37.0902,-95.7129,"The United States’ National Emergencies often deal with domestic issues. While all national emergencies are declared out of the United States’ interest and impact the US in some way, 23 of the National Emergencies were directly focused on domestic issues within the United States. They include the following: (click on links to expand)","1. (1917-1921) WOODROW WILSON: Emergency in Water Transportation of the United States ! 2. (1933-1933) FDR: Declaring a Bank Holiday ! 3. (1939 - 1952) FDR: Proclaiming a National Emergency in Connection with the Observance, Safeguarding, and Enforcement of Neutrality and the Strengthening of the National Defense Within the Limits of Peace-Time Authorizations ! 4. (1941 - 1952) FDR: Proclaiming That an Unlimited National Emergency Confronts This Country, Which Requires That Its Military, Naval, Air and Civilian Defenses Be Put on the Basis of Readiness to Repel Any and All Acts or Threats of Aggression Directed Toward Any Part of the Western Hemisphere ! 5.

(1984 - 1985) RONALD REAGAN:  Continuation of Export Control Regulations II","During World War I, Allied forces had a shortage of ships after German U-boat attacks. The private shipping industry was not efficient. The United States wanted to ensure troops, food, weapons, and other supplies could be transported to Europe. Under Proclamation 1354, Wilson gave the U.S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation the ability to use privately owned boats and ships for war. The government took over water transportation so they could prioritize resources and production for war. This centralization influenced later transportation frameworks during times of emergency. This national emergency strengthened U.S. maritime power and expanded the war fleet. ! Due to the Great Depression, many Americans were rapidly withdrawing their money from banks due to necessity and a lack of trust in the banking system. FDR implemented a 4 day banking holiday with Proclamation 2039 to shut down all federal banks and then reopen them. After they reopened, FDR introduced the Emergency Banking Act to restore American confidence in the banks. The act expanded federal authority during a banking crisis, allowing the President, Secretary of the Treasury, comptroller of the currency, and the Federal Reserve to restrict or issue banking functions, including loans and currency issuing. ! Proclamation 2352 was issued in the aftermath of Germany’s invasion of Poland, marking the beginning of World War II. The proclamation allowed the US to remain neutral within the bounds of peacetime laws while increasing their military readiness. It allowed the US to increase military power without involving themselves in the war. ! In response to Nazi expansion in Europe and Japan’s increased aggression across Asia, the US declared an unlimited national emergency. German U-boats had attacked neutral shipping vessels, including ones that belonged the US. This increased security concerns within the US. This proclamation allowed the US to escalate potential involvement in World War II. It showed Americans the seriousness of the global situation to justify the reallocation of resources to the military and set the stage for the US joining the allied powers. It also broadened the presidential powers to control resources and increase defense strategies. !Truman cited Korea as a reason for Proclamation 2914, which declared a national emergency. He urged Americans to prioritize the country’s security against the threat of “communist imperialism.” He created an Executive Order to create the Office of Defense Mobilization, which held all oversight over defense manpower. Essentially, he gave full control of the steel industry to the Secretary of Commerce for the purposes of war. The public and the court did not agree with Truman’s executive order which he tried to justify with the state of national emergency. Both a federal district court and the Supreme Court of the United States held the decision that his actions to nationalize the steel industry were unconstitutional. ! In 1970, Postal Workers in Manhattan and Brooklyn went on strike. It was the first mass stoppage for the Postal Service and the first walkout ever against the federal government. Workers cited Congress' 41% salary increase that Congress gave to themselves in the previous year. Postal workers wanted more pay and retirement benefits. Nixon subsequently declared a national emergency under Proclamation 3792, and put military troops to the NYC post offices, threatening postal workers to return to their jobs. Ultimately, postal workers won, gaining the right to bargain for working conditions and pay, and forced the Postal Reorganization Act to be passed. They got a 6% pay raise initially, and and an addition 8% after the act was signed. ! Nixon invoked the Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA) to justify a national emergency. He imposed a 10% surcharge on all dutiable imports (any import subject to customs) into the United States after the US' international monetary reserves experienced a rapid decline. Essentially, the US could no longer pay for essential imports based on its own export capital, so the US was running through its reserves. This temporary tariff was to pressure countries (especially Japan) to help the US fix the balance of payments crisis by paying more for imports to the US. ! During the Cold War, the U.S. was concerned with national security threats regarding dual-use items (tech both civilians and military could use). This executive order simply declared a national emergency to continue the expiring Export Administration Act, which controls the framework for sensitive good exports. ! See above. These acts are in line with Reagan's strict anti-communist stance."
Germany,2,51.1657,10.4515,The National Emergencies that have affected Germany the most were declared around World War II in the US’ positioning itself against Nazi Germany and Japan’s expansion across Europe and Asia.

Iran,3,32.4279,53.688,"Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 in Iran and the hostage crisis, Iran and the US severed ties. The relationship between the two and the tension regarding both countries involvement in terrorism, imperialism, human rights violations, and nuclear power is executed through a proxy war between the two in the Middle East, with Israel as the United States’ main ally. ",1. (1979 - Ongoing) JIMMY CARTER: Blocking Iranian Government Property! 2. (1980 - 1981) JIMMY CARTER: Further Prohibitions on Transactions with Iran,"Ten days after the Iran hostage crisis at the US Embassy in Tehran began during the Iranian Revolution, Carter declared a national emergency and froze all Iranian government assets in the United States. It has been renewed every year since, making it the oldest existing state of emergency. It continues non-nuclear US sanctions against Iran. ! Under a new national emergency, imposed more sanctions on Iran in the first of two executive orders. These sanctions included all Iranian goods or services into the US except for news materials, and transactions with foreign travelers in Iran. A second executive order imposed further economic sanctions on Iran. A third executive order revoked these prohibitions set in the previous two. Frozen government assets and other sanctions remain."
Nicaragua,2,12.8654,-85.2072,"Nicaragua and the US currently have a bilateral relationship, but the this was not the case in the 1980s, when national emergency policy concerned the Central American country. The Second Red Scare prompted the United States to take a very anti-socialist stance in global politics. The US began in a proxy war against the socialist Sandinista group by funding the right-wing Contras. The Sandinistas were accused of human rights violations against the region’s indigenous people. The Contras implemented US CIA guerrilla warfare tactics to terrorize civilians as well as Sandinistas. The US at times used illegal funds to fund the Contras. Known as the Iran-Contra affair, under Ronald Reagan the US participated in illicit trade with the enemy state of Iran, and then used the money from those sales to fund the Contras. The Contras and Sandinistas were both largely disliked by Nicaraguans, and peace talks in 1989 demobilized both groups. In 1990, the Sandinistas officially lost power in an election.",1. (1985 - 1990) RONALD REAGAN: Prohibiting Trade and Certain Other Transactions Involving Nicaragua,"During the Cold War, the Sandinistas, a Christian Socialist group, came to power in Nicaragua. Before backing the right-wing Contras to overthrow the Sandinistas, the United States declared a national emergency to block imports and exports between Nicaragua and the US, with some exceptions for humanitarian aid or money for the Contra rebel groups. "
South Africa,1,-30.5595,22.9375,"South African apartheid came of international scrutiny in the 1980s. While Apartheid had been occurring for nearly forty years, the dwindling of the Cold War and citizen pressure made the US finally interfere with sanctions.  ",1. (1985 - 1991) RONALD REAGAN: Prohibiting Trade and Certain Other Transactions Involving South Africa,"Senate Democrats wanted to pass the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 which passed both the house and the senate. However, it took two tries. After the first try, in which it failed during a Republican filibuster, Reagan declared this national emergency. In it, Reagan prohibited bank loans with exceptions, computer and tech exports, and nuclear/military exports with exceptions. The order called for an increase in scholarships for apartheid affected victims. Those living under apartheid and Americans largely felt like this was not enough. Democrats in Congress tried again to pass the bill, which imposed much stricter sanctions on South Africa should apartheid continue. The act was successful in both the house and senate. Ultimately, Reagan vetoed the act because it would cause ""economic warfare."" This veto was viewed incredibly negatively by anti-apartheid leaders. Republican Senator Richard Lugar turned against the President he once supported to lead a override of the veto, which was successful."
Libya,3,26.3351,17.2283,"Libya and the US had fraught relations for much of the latter twentieth century when Libya was under Muammar Gaddafi’s rule. Disputes over oil, Israel, and the US blaming Libya for various bombings across Europe led to the United States bombing Libya and then Libya taking responsibility for an aircraft explosion in the United Kingdom. The US helped anti-Gaddafi rebels fight the Libyan army. The revolution was successful. After this and an Islamic militant group targeting two US facilities in Benghazi, relations between the two countries became more cooperative.",1. (1986 - 2004) RONALD REAGAN: Prohibiting Trade and Certain Transactions Involving Libya,"In 1985, Libya was blamed for funding assault rifle and hand grenade attacks that took place in Vienna and Rome. Abu Nidal took responsibility for the attack, which was carried out in retaliation for the Israeli bombing of the Palestinian Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunisia. The US blamed Libya for funding the attack. Italy blamed Syria and Iran. The US then prohibited any economic transaction by any United States person and Libya."
Panama,1,8.5379,-80.7821,"The US has long since inserted itself in Panamanian politics for Panama’s geographic location and what it could do for trade. The US was desperate to build an American-owned Canal. They were successful and owned it until 1979. Then, Noriega came into power. Manuel Noriega was the unelected military dictator of Panama from 1983 to 1989. He had ties with American intelligence and large masses of money he collected via drug trafficking. The US invaded Panama in 1989 to remove in from power after his ties with other countries’ intelligence agencies were also uncovered and his drug trafficking involvement was publicly revealed. During his authoritative reign, Panama and the US saw weakening relations. ",1.

Occupied Territory of Palestine,1,31.9522,35.2332,"Palestine is greatly affected by many US policies, but is only directly named in one National Emergency. This national emergency, however, has not been thoroughly enacted, as described below:","1. (2024 - Ongoing) JOE BIDEN: Imposing Certain Sanctions of Persons Undermining Peace, Security, and Stability in the West Bank","This National Emergency, enacted under Executive Order 14115, claims to prohibit transactions involving property of any foreigner who is complicit (indirectly or directly) to actions that threaten stabilization in the West Bank. The executive order’s sanctions include any foreigner participating in indirect or direct planning, violence, threat of violence to civilians, property destruction, seizure or dispossession of property, and invoking of fear. The executive order also sanctions any entities, including governments, whose members have engaged in these activities or who have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for any such activity. 
 

 It is important to understand that the United States is targeting foreigners here; since the US is not a foreign body to itself, it is not condemning itself for providing the weaponry and personnel that is contributing to the destruction of Palestine in both Gaza and the West Bank. Nor does it seem to condemn Americans who go to the region to join the Israeli Defense Forces that are perpetuating violence and definitively participating in any of the actions listed above. As Israel is technically a foreign body, this National Emergency should require sanctioning the Israeli government and should cease all transactions between the United States and Israel. That is, curiously, not happening. So far, only four Israeli settlers enacting violence in the West Bank have been sanctioned: David Chai Chasdai, Einan Tanjil, Shalom Zicherman, and Yinon Levi. The actions they - assaulting Palestinian civilians and causing property damage, assaulting Israeli peace activists, and creating an atmosphere of fear in the West Bank - are actions that the IDF and the Israeli government enact on a daily basis as well."
